This library, ADAL for Java, will no longer receive new feature improvements. Instead, use the new
[MSAL4J](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java).

* If you are starting a new project, you can get started with the
  [MSAL4J docs](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java/wiki)
  for details about the scenarios, usage, and relevant concepts.
* If your application is using the previous ADAL for Java library, you can follow this
  [migration guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/migrate-adal-msal-java)
  to update to MSAL4J.
* Existing applications relying on ADAL for Java will continue to work.

The ADAL for Java library enables Java applications to authenticate with Azure AD and get tokens to access Azure AD protected web resources.

## Update to MSAL4J now!

[MSAL4J](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java) is the new authentication library to be used with the Microsoft identity platform.

Building on top of ADAL, MSAL works with both the [Open ID Connect certified Azure AD V2 endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/about-microsoft-identity-platform) and the new social identity solution from Microsoft, Azure AD B2C.

ADAL4J is in maintenance mode and no new features will be added going forward except for security fixes. All our ongoing efforts will be focused on improving [MSAL4J](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java). 

## Installation and usage

You can find the steps for installation and basic usage documented in the [ADAL4J Basics Wiki](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-java/wiki/ADAL4J-Basics).
